## Operational Threat Vectors

**English:**
Operational Threat Vectors are the paths or methods attackers use to exploit weaknesses in an organization’s day-to-day operations, processes, or workflows to cause harm, steal data, or disrupt services.
These are not just technical attacks (like hacking a server) — they can include human errors, procedural gaps, supply chain weaknesses, or insider misuse.

**Urdu:**
Operational Threat Vectors wo tareeqe hote hain jin se attacker kisi organization ke rozana operations, processes ya workflows ka faida utha ke nuksaan pohchata hai, data churaata hai, ya service disrupt karta hai.
Ye sirf technical attack nahin hote — isme human galti, process ki kamzori, supply chain issues, ya insider misuse bhi aate hain.

Supply Chain Attack	-------------------Compromising a vendor to reach target----------------	Vendor ko hack karke main target pe attack karna
Process Misconfigurations-----------------	Wrong settings in operations--------------------	Operations me settings ka ghalat hona
Social Engineering in workflows	---------------Manipulating staff during routine tasks	-----------Routine kaam me staff ko manipulate karna
